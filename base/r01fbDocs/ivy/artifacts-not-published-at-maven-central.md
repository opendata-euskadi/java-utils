Copyrighted artifacts
=====================
Some artifacts are NOT published at MAVEN CENTRAL due to licensing problems
... this is the case of javax.ejb / javax.servlet-api or javax.jms

The only workarround is to put all those artifacts in {dev_home}/ivy_libs/local
... simply extract the local_libs.7z file at {dev_home}/ivy_libs/local
