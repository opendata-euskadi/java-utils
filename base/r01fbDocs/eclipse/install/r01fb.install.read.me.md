How to install r01fb eclipse env
==========================================

## [1] - Install eclipse as described at `eclipse_install.read.me.md`

Ensure that a JRE called R01FB_JRE was created

> `[Java] > [Installed JREs]`: Add a NEW JRE named R01FB_JRE

## [3] - Import all R01FB projects in the workspace 

**BEWARE**

DO *NOT* locate the projects in the [workspace]: locate them all at an external folder like `{dev_home}\projects_r01fb`


## [4] - Import the eclipse working sets

(requires the AnyEditTools plugin)

`[File] > [import] > [WorkingSets]` and select the one at [r01fbDocs]\eclipse\working_sets\r01fb.workingsets.wst
