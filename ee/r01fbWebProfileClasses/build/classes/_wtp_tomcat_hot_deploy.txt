Install native DLL for ARP in Windows(http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/apr.html#Windows):
	Tomcat can use the Apache Portable Runtime to provide superior scalability, performance, and better integration with native server technologies.
	Download DLL and copy dll into c:\Windows\System32\ directory.

Add these parameters to the tomcat VM
    -client -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx1024m -Xms256m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC


See how to configure Tomcat to enable hot deploying at:
    http://ducquoc.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/eclipse-wtp-tomcat-hot-deploy/

    Publishing: Auto publish when resources changes (so as to hot-deploy text resources like .properties, .html, .jsp,... and packaged resources like .jar, .zip ),
                the interval should be small (1 or 0 sec).
	Switch to “Modules” tab, since you already added the web app to the server, there should be at least a “module” with the specified context root (path URL).
	Select that module, then click “Edit” button, uncheck the “Auto reloading enabled” checkbox, click OK.

	Now your module should have “Auto Reload” setting as disabled (equivalence to <Context reloadable=”false” … /> in server.xml/context.xml of Tomcat)

 	Save the changes (at least make sure the two above has been applied already).
